# ICS3U-Summative
Summative assignment for my Grade 11 Computer Science course

The assigned task was to create a grocery store simulator to be ran in the terminal. Written entirely in 'c', the project is a culmunation of all the key concepts learnt in the course.
The program must have options for Managers, who must login using the set pin, and a login option for buyers where they can either LOGIN to an existing account or CREATE a new one. All of the login information, carts and grocery store inventory are store in text files which will be edited, written, and read in the program.
The project demonstrates an indepth understanding of pointers, functions, strcutures, file operations, etc.
